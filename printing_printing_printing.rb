# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\Apr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"

puts %Q{
    There is something on here.
    With this weird quote
    We'll be able to type as much as we like
    Even 4 lines if we went, or 5 or 6.
